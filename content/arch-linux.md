For a year now, Arch Linux has been powering my personal computers and servers. I have a lot of appreciation for Arch Linux, so I would like to share my experience using it and how it’s benefitted me.  

Firstly, I would like you to know that I was using Ubuntu for years until they “introduced” Snaps. I remember how annoying it was trying to get applications when Ubuntu was prioritizing their snap applications over everything else.

From there on, it took a turn for the worst. Ubuntu as a desktop just wasn't as stable as it used to be.
 It was very buggy, and I eventually lost interest. It was time to discover the unknown and see what was out there.  

I was officially a distro hopper. I was hopping all over the place. I even managed to kill one of my hard disks by reinstalling so many times.  

I was a traveling man, traveling from one distro to another, exploring the distro worlds. I had known of Arch, but I was intimidated by it, so I had maneuvered ways around it. I tried Manjaro, Arco Linux, Arch Labs, EndeavourOS, etc.  

But one morning I woke up feeling fresh, with no bad dreams and no noises during the night, didn't have to get up to pee. It was just one of those nights of sleep when you close your eyes. Then when they open again, you're ready to go. I also happened to have a glorious cup of coffee.  

The sleep and the coffee were all I needed to give Arch "Installation" a try. Yes, before you can try Arch, you have to try installing it first, and I ain't talking about no Calamares installation. I'm talking about the black screen with text and the wiki.

I had gotten everything ready, the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/), youtube tutorials, and more coffee. I had to install Arch with an encrypted disk, as I usually install all my distros with encryption. So that added pressure.  

After following the wiki and some youtube tutorials, I finally made it to the reboot stage. Holy crap was that stressful. I would imagine it felt like defusing a bomb, having to choose between cutting the cable or not. (To reboot or not to reboot, that was the question).  

I had rebooted, and it didn’t end well. I had to redo the installation a second time.  

After the second time, it worked. I was in the Arch. I was an ecstatic man. I felt like I had acquired a few skills and was ready to unleash them to the world, mwahahah.  

So days, months, and more months went by, no urges to hop at all. I had learned more about Linux and how all the pieces fitted together. I realized that I didn’t know much about Linux until Arch.  

Arch Linux has the best documentation on Linux and open-source software in existence. I was clicking and scrolling my way through their wiki and learning so much. I was so glad I took the time to know Arch Linux, and I haven't looked back.  

So what’s the moral of the story? Don’t let fear hold you back, nothing is as hard as it seems, tough times don’t last, but tough people do?
To put it simply, I guess the story is that I use Arch… *by the way*.
