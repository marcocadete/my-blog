                    <p>For a year now, Arch Linux has been powering my personal computers and servers. I have a lot of appreciation for Arch Linux, so I would like to share my experience using it and how it’s benefitted me.</p>
<p>Firstly, I would like you to know that I was using Ubuntu for years until they “introduced” Snaps. I remember how annoying it was trying to get applications when Ubuntu was prioritizing their snap applications over everything else.</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/snaps.png" alt="Snaps"></p>
<p>From there on, it took a turn for the worst. Ubuntu as a desktop just wasn&rsquo;t as stable as it used to be.
It was very buggy, and I eventually lost interest. It was time to discover the unknown and see what was out there.</p>
<p>I was officially a distro hopper. I was hopping all over the place. I even managed to kill one of my hard disks by reinstalling so many times.</p>
<p>I was a traveling man, traveling from one distro to another, exploring the distro worlds. I had known of Arch, but I was intimidated by it, so I had maneuvered ways around it. I tried Manjaro, Arco Linux, Arch Labs, EndeavourOS, etc.</p>
<p>But one morning I woke up feeling fresh, with no bad dreams and no noises during the night, didn&rsquo;t have to get up to pee. It was just one of those nights of sleep when you close your eyes. Then when they open again, you&rsquo;re ready to go. I also happened to have a glorious cup of coffee.</p>
<p>The sleep and the coffee were all I needed to give Arch &ldquo;Installation&rdquo; a try. Yes, before you can try Arch, you have to try installing it first, and I ain&rsquo;t talking about no Calamares installation. I&rsquo;m talking about the black screen with text and the wiki.</p>
<h6 id="calamares-vs-arch-installation">Calamares vs Arch Installation</h6>
<p><img src="/img/posts/calamares-vs-arch_install.png" alt="Calamares Install" title="Calamares vs Arch Installation"></p>
<p>I had gotten everything ready, the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">Arch wiki</a>, youtube tutorials, and more coffee. I had to install Arch with an encrypted disk, as I usually install all my distros with encryption. So that added pressure.</p>
<p>After following the wiki and some youtube tutorials, I finally made it to the reboot stage. Holy crap was that stressful. I would imagine it felt like defusing a bomb, having to choose between cutting the cable or not. (To reboot or not to reboot, that was the question).</p>
<p>I had rebooted, and it didn’t end well. I had to redo the installation a second time.</p>
<p>After the second time, it worked. I was in the Arch. I was an ecstatic man. I felt like I had acquired a few skills and was ready to unleash them to the world, mwahahah.</p>
<p>So days, months, and more months went by, no urges to hop at all. I had learned more about Linux and how all the pieces fitted together. I realized that I didn’t know much about Linux until Arch.</p>
<p>Arch Linux has the best documentation on Linux and open-source software in existence. I was clicking and scrolling my way through their wiki and learning so much. I was so glad I took the time to know Arch Linux, and I haven&rsquo;t looked back.</p>
<p>So what’s the moral of the story? Don’t let fear hold you back, nothing is as hard as it seems, tough times don’t last, but tough people do?
To put it simply, I guess the story is that I use Arch… <em>by the way</em>.</p>
