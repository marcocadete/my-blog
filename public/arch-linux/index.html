                    <p>For a few months now, Arch Linux has been powering my personal computers and servers. I have a lot of appreciation for Arch Linux, so I would like to share my experience using it and how it’s benefitted me.</p>
<p>Firstly, I would like you to know that I was using Ubuntu for years until they “introduced” Snaps. I remember how annoying it was trying to get applications when Ubuntu was prioritizing their snap applications over everything else.</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/snaps.png" alt="Snaps"></p>
<p>Not long after the Snaps saga, Ubuntu as a desktop just wasn&rsquo;t as stable as it used to be.
It was buggy, and so I had decided it was time to discover the unknown and see what was out there.</p>
<p>I became a distro hopper. I was hopping all over the place and eventually one hop lead to my hard disks demise. A quick trip to the store and I was back in action.</p>
<p>I had known of Arch, but I was intimidated by it, so I had maneuvered ways around it. I tried Manjaro, Arco Linux, Arch Labs, EndeavourOS, etc.</p>
<p>But one morning I woke up feeling fresh, with enough hours of sleep, no bad dreams, no noises during the night, and I didn&rsquo;t have to get up to pee. It was just one of those rare nights of sleep. I also happened to have a glorious cup of coffee.</p>
<p>The sleep and the coffee were all I needed to give Arch &ldquo;Installation&rdquo; a try, because to try Arch, you have to make it through the install, like an initiation. Let me be clear, I ain&rsquo;t talking about no Calamares installation. I&rsquo;m talking about the black screen with text and the wiki.</p>
<h6 id="calamares-vs-arch-installation">Calamares vs Arch Installation</h6>
<p><img src="/img/posts/calamares-vs-arch_install.png" alt="Calamares Install" title="Calamares vs Arch Installation"></p>
<p>I had gotten everything ready, the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">Arch wiki</a>, a YoutTube tutorial, and more coffee. I had to install Arch with an encrypted disk, as I usually install all my distros with encryption. So that added pressure.</p>
<p>After following the wiki and YouTube tutorial, I had finally made it to the reboot stage. Holy crap was that stressful. I would imagine it feeling like defusing a bomb, having to choose between cutting the cable or not (To reboot or not to reboot, that was the question).</p>
<p>I had rebooted, and it didn’t end well. I had to redo the installation a second time.</p>
<p>After the second time it worked and I was in the Arch, I was ecstatic. I felt like I had acquired a few skills and was ready to unleash them to the world, mwahahah.</p>
<p>So months went by, no urges to hop at all. I had learned more about Linux and how all the pieces fitted together. I realized that I didn’t know much about Linux until Arch.</p>
<p>Arch has the best documentation on Linux and open-source software in existence. I was clicking and scrolling my way through their wiki and learning so much. I was so glad I took the time to know Arch, and I haven&rsquo;t looked back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stable, has tons of software (that are not outdated) and is bloat free. I also really appreciate having the array of choices that Arch provides. If you want control and understanding of the inner workings of your Linux distribution then Arch Linux is the answer.</p>
<p>So get a good night&rsquo;s rest, warm up that coffee and try that installation out. You won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>
